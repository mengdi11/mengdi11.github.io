abstract: This meta-analysis examines the prevalence of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) and its symptoms among bereaved individuals in China, revealing a combined prevalence of 8.9% for PGD and 32.4% for its symptoms. Higher prevalence rates were observed among those who lost their only child and those affected by earthquakes, highlighting a significant need for targeted grief counseling services in this population.

summary: This meta-analysis in China found that prolonged grief disorder (PGD) and its symptoms affect a significant proportion of bereaved individuals, with PGD prevalence estimated at 8.9% and symptoms at 32.4%. Particularly high rates were observed among parents who lost their only child and earthquake survivors.

Background: The prevalence of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) and its symptoms among the bereaved population in China vary considerably.

Aims: This meta-analysis aims to estimate the prevalence of PGD and its symptoms among bereaved individuals in China.

Methods: We conducted a literature search in major Chinese and English databases from their inception to 4 October 2023, for cross-sectional studies on the prevalence of PGD or its symptoms in bereaved Chinese individuals. The risk of bias of the included studies and certainty of the evidence were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data ('JBI checklist') and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE), respectively. The 'metaprop' package in R V.4.1.2 was used to synthesise the prevalence.

Results: A total of 28 studies involving 10 994 bereaved individuals were included in the analysis, with JBI checklist scores between 3 and 7. The combined prevalence (95% confidence interval) of PGD and its symptoms was 8.9% (4.2% to 17.6%) and 32.4% (18.2% to 50.8%), respectively. PGD and its symptoms were most prevalent among those who had lost their only child (22.7%) and those bereaved by earthquakes (80.4%), respectively. The GRADE system assigned a very low certainty level to the evidence for the pooled prevalence of PGD and its symptoms.

Conclusions: The pooled prevalence of PGD and its symptoms indicate a potential high need for grief counselling services among bereaved individuals in China. This need is particularly pronounced in those who have lost their only child and those bereaved due to earthquakes. Further methodologically rigorous studies are needed to provide more accurate prevalence estimates.
